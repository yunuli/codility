/**
 Consider n coins aligned in a row. Each coin is showing heads at the beginning.
 Then, n people turn over corresponding coins as follows. Person i reverses coins with numbers that are multiples of i. That is, person i flips coins i, 2 · i, 3 · i, . . . until no more appropriate coins remain.
count the number of coins showing tail
 Time complexity :
 O(log(n)) or
 O(1): use math operation on floating point numers
